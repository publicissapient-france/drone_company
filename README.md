# Register your cloud function to the game engine
Open the [Dashboard](https://deploy-techevent-drone.appspot.com/)
Run the following example command with your own values:

```
make register team="YOUR TEAM ID HERE" url="YOUR CLOUD FUNCTION URL HERE"
```

# Deploy your cloud function 

Run the following command:

```
make deploy
```
# GamePlay

There are three things that you need to know.
   *  First to pick up a parcel just move the drone to the parcel's position
   *  Secondly carrying to much parcel will slow down your drone. But you can take as parcels as you want.
   *  third 5 levels exists. Each one will bring in the game some extra features.
       For example: 
        *  Some parcels could only be picked up by you but other are share. The are rainbow colors
        *  Some parcels increase your speed. They have lightning bolt on top. You don't need to delivery this one
        *  Some parcels give you no point or even worse will take you point.
    We advice you to go step by step. You should implement pick as a first step.    
         
# Move your drone

Type of command to send to move your drone :

```
{
	teamId: 'your team id should be set here',
	command: {
	  name: 'MOVE',
	  location: {
	  	latitude: latitude where you want the drone to go,
	  	longitude: longitude where you want the drone to go
	  }
	}
}
```

# Event received

}
```

*Note: you will only receive events from your drone*

# All Events 

"**event**" attribut is the type of event currently received.
"**event**" values can be one of the following:
- WAITING_FOR_COMMAND (the drone is waiting for a new command even if its operating)
- MOVING (the drone is currently moving to its move destination set in the command)
- MOVE_LOCATION_ERROR (if the move location you sent in command is not valid)

If your drone is currently flying to a point then you will receive at each tick an event "MOVING" until it reached its destination.
If your drone is not moving and so is waiting for a command you will receive a each tick an event "WAITING_FOR_COMMAND".

# Managing parcels

**droneInfo.parcels** attribut contains parcels that you have already grabbed and that you should deliver.

**availableParcelsForTeam** attribut you will get all the parcels that your drone can get.
There is currently two type of parcel:

**"type": "CLASSIC"**
Typical parcel when the drone grab one of those he will have to go to the destination to earn the point.

**"type": "SPEED_BOOST"**
This one is special it will allow your drone to go faster !
For this one you don't need to deliver it.

There is currently two type of teamID:

**"teamId": "black-543",**
Only for you

**"teamId": "all",**
For all teams.
